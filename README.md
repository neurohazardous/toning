## Status
Done (in terms of the sofware development part) - The physiology data (EKG, breathing rates...) has been [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07171-2). We still have to analyze and process both qualitative (interviews) and EEG data. 


## Objective
To write software that will (1) take in a breathing pattern file, (2) animate it as a inflating/deflating circile, and (3) synchronize multiple streams of data (EEG, audio...)
